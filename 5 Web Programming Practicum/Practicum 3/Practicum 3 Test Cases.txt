Practicum 3 Test Cases
1. Ignore zeros in front 
012 -> 12

2. Pressing = without operator, value remains
"1 =" -> 1

3. Basic operations (only last two operands will be used)
8-1=7
8*2=16
10/3=3r
1+1+1+5 = 6

4. From a result, continue with operations
8+1=9+1=10
8-1=7-1=6
8*2=16*2=32
8/2=4/2=2

5. Operations which start with 0
0+1  -> no operation, 1 is shown
0-1  -> no operation, 1 is shown
0/1  -> no operation, 1 is shown
0*1  -> no operation, 1 is shown

6. AC to clear value
AC -> display 0

7. Append value to a result 
1+1=23+1=24 (append 3 to first evaluation)

8. Override previous operator
1+-1=0

9. Refresh/default value of M1 and M2
M1 -> 0
M2 -> 0

10. M1+ storage
10 M1+ AC M1 + 10 = 20

11. M2+ storage 
10 M2+ AC M2 + 10 = 20
M1 + M2 = 20

12. Errors
1/0 = E
999999999+1 = E
999999999x3 = E

13. Comma for every 3 digits
9999 -> 9,999
9999999 -> 9,999,999
999999999 -> 999,999,999

Additional Test Cases
AC 1 + 0 + 3 = 4
AC 1 + 0 x 2 = 3
AC 1 - 0 x 3 = -2
AC 9 * 0 = 0
100 - 0 = 100
AC 100 + 0 = 100
AC 1/0 = E (make sure you press all sorts of combination of buttons and nothing can work except AC)

AC M1+ M1 -> should be 0, should not get NaN
AC M2+ M2 -> should be 0, should not get NaN

999,999,999 (pressing any numbers does not append) M2+ AC M2 / 23 = 43,478,261R / 23 = 1,890,359R / 23 = 82190R 5 / 23 = 35,735 / 23 = 1,554R / 23 = 68R / 23 = 3R / 23 = 0R **or should it be 0?** M2+ + 9 = 9 + 1 = 10 M2, final result should be 0, should not get NaN

1 - 999,999,999 = -999,999,998 (pressing any numbers does not append) M1+ AC M1 - 1 = -999,999,999 - 0 = -999,999,999 - 1 = E AC M1 / 23 = -43,478,261R / 23 = -1,890,359R / 23 = -82,190R 5 / 23 = -35,735 / 23 = -1,554R / 23 = -68R / 23 = -3R / 23 = 0R **or should it be 0?** M1+ + 10 = 10 + 1 = 11 M1, final result should be 0, should not get NaN

1 - 999,999,999 = -999,999,998 + 200 = -999,999,798 M1+
AC 1 - 888,888,888 = -888,888,887 + 555,555,555 = -333,333,332 M2+
M1 / M2 = 3R
AC 1 - 3 = -2 M1+
M1 * M2 = 666,666,664
